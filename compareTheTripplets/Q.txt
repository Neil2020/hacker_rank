Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories clarity, originality and difficulty. The rating for Alice's challenge is the tripplet a = (a[0],a[1],a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to calculate their comparison points by comparing each categories: 
- if a[i] > b[i] then Alice  is awarded 1 point
- if a[i] < b[i] then bob is awarded 1 point
- if a[i] = b[i] then neither person receives a point
